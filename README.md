```

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

* **🌐 .NET SDK:** (Specify version, e.g., .NET 7.0 or .NET 8.0)
* **🟩 Node.js & npm:** (Specify versions, e.g., Node.js LTS - v18.x or v20.x, npm v9.x or v10.x)
* **🅰️ Angular CLI:** Globally installed (`npm install -g @angular/cli`)
* **💾 Microsoft SQL Server:** (e.g., Express, Developer, or Standard edition)
* **🐙 Git:** For version control.


## ⚙️ Setup and Installation Guide

Let's get your local environment up and running!

### 🔌 Backend API (BlogApp.API)

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/developer-2046/BlogApp.git](https://github.com/developer-2046/BlogApp.git)
    cd BlogApp
    ```

2.  **Database Connection Configuration:**
    * Open the backend project's configuration file, usually `BlogApp.API/appsettings.json`.
    * Locate the `ConnectionStrings` section and update `DefaultConnection` to point to your SQL Server instance.
    * **Example `appsettings.json`:**
        ```json
        {
          "ConnectionStrings": {
            "DefaultConnection": "Server=YOUR_SERVER_NAME;Database=BlogAppDB;User ID=YOUR_USER_ID;Password=YOUR_PASSWORD;Trusted_Connection=False;Encrypt=True;TrustServerCertificate=False;Connection Timeout=30;"
            // For local dev with Windows Auth, you might use:
            // "DefaultConnection": "Server=(localdb)\\mssqllocaldb;Database=BlogAppDB;Trusted_Connection=True;MultipleActiveResultSets=true"
          },
          "Logging": { /* ... */ },
          "AllowedHosts": "*"
        }
        ```
    * ⚠️ **Important:** Ensure the specified database user has permissions to create/modify the database, or that the database (e.g., `BlogAppDB`) already exists.

3.  **Database Migrations (Entity Framework Core):**
    * Navigate to the `BlogApp.API` directory in your terminal.
    * If you haven't already, install EF Core tools: `dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef` (or ensure it's installed locally to the project).
    * To create and apply migrations:
        ```bash
        # If creating migrations for the first time or after model changes:
        dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreateOrDescriptiveName # e.g., AddUserAndPostEntities
        dotnet ef database update
        ```
        ```bash
        # If migrations already exist and you just need to apply them:
        dotnet ef database update
        ```

4.  **Build & Run the API:**
    * Still in the `BlogApp.API` directory:
    * Build the project:
        ```bash
        dotnet build
        ```
    * Run the API:
        ```bash
        dotnet run
        ```
    * Look at the console output to see the URL where the API is running (e.g., `http://localhost:5000` or `https://localhost:5001`).

### 🖥️ Frontend UI (BlogApp.UI)

1.  **Navigate to Frontend Directory:**
    ```bash
    cd BlogApp.UI  # Or the actual name of your Angular project folder
    ```

2.  **Install npm Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Configure API Endpoint for Angular:**
    * Open the environment configuration files:
        * `src/environments/environment.ts` (for development)
        * `src/environments/environment.prod.ts` (for production builds)
    * Update the `apiUrl` property to match your running backend API URL.
    * **Example `src/environments/environment.ts`:**
        ```typescript
        export const environment = {
          production: false,
          apiUrl: 'https://localhost:5001/api' // Adjust protocol, port, and base path as needed
        };
        ```

4.  **Serve the Angular App:**
    ```bash
    ng serve -o
    ```
    This command compiles the Angular app, starts a development server, and opens it in your default web browser (usually at `http://localhost:4200/`).

## 🚀 Using the Application

1.  ✅ Make sure both the backend API and the frontend Angular app are running.
2.  🌐 Open your browser and go to the Angular app's URL (e.g., `http://localhost:4200/`).
3.  **Sign Up / Log In:** Find the "Register" or "Sign Up" link to create a new account. Once done, use the "Login" or "Sign In" page with your credentials.
4.  **Create Posts:** After logging in, you should find an option like "New Post" or "Write a Post". Here you can add a title and your content.
5.  **Browse Posts:** The main page or a dedicated "Blog" / "Posts" section will typically list available posts. Click on a post to read it in full.
6.  **Manage Your Posts:** If you're logged in and viewing one of your own posts, you should see options to "Edit" or "Delete" it.

📝 **A Little Note:** This README provides a general guide. Remember to:

* **Fill in Specifics:** Update placeholders for versions (e.g., `.NET 8.0`, `Node.js v20.x`), file paths if they differ, and any specific configuration details unique to your setup.
* **Elaborate on Features:** As you implement more cool stuff, add details to the "Features" section!
* **Deployment:** If you have instructions for deploying this app (e.g., to Azure, AWS, Docker), consider adding a "Deployment" section.
* **Visual Studio Users:** If you're using Visual Studio, you can typically open the `.sln` file to manage both projects. You might need to configure multiple startup projects to run the API and Angular app simultaneously.

Happy Blogging! 🎉
